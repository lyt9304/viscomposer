%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is

%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page

%% first page will be refused.

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{We present a programmable integrated development environment (IDE), VisComposer, that supports the development of
 expressive visualizations using a drag-and-drop visual interface. VisComposer  exposes the programmability by customizing desired components within a modularized visualization composition pipeline, effectively balancing the capability gap between expert coders and visualization artists.
The implemented system empowers users to compose comprehensive visualizations with real-time preview and optimization features,
and supports prototyping, sharing and reuse of the effects by means of an intuitive visual composer. We demonstrate the performance of VisComposer with a variety of examples.
