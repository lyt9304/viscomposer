\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:con}
This paper presents a visual authoring environment that enhances the conventional visualization pipeline with an abstractive design structure and programmable scheme. The contribution is a novel visual programmable design scheme that visually represents the modularized visualization pipeline and allows for an interactive management and composition of the visualization process. The implemented system not only allows easy visualization design and development, but also provides a mechanism for managing the designs of the associated visual resources in a single environment. One of its distinctive features is its inclusion of textual programming to support the programmable development of novel visualization effects. The interactivity of the program enables fast content development, quick design iteration, and customizable effects. Finally, the results made with our system can be easily integrated into the workflow of other visualization programs.
